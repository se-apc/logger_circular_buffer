# Example

This example starts a process that repeatedly logs messages. You can run it
normally (`iex -S mix`) or with Erlang distribution enabled. We'll run it using
Erlang distribution so that you can simultaneously see what gets logged with
Elixir's default `:console` logger on the first node and what you can get when
you remote shell into it.

First, start the example application as `node1`:

```bash
cd example
iex --name node1@0.0.0.0 -S mix
```

Open another terminal and remote shell into `node1`:

```bash
iex --name node2@0.0.0.0 --remsh node1@0.0.0.0
```

At this point, you should see `:console` logger messages scrolling by on
`node1`. Your remote shell session on `node2` will be nice and quiet. In real
use, you will probably consider disabling the `:console` logger, but it is
informative for this example.

Now, on `node2`, try attaching to the log so that you can see the messages:

```elixir
iex(node1@0.0.0.0)> RingLogger.attach
:ok

12:48:43.142 [debug] 10

12:48:43.142 [debug] 11

...

iex(node1@0.0.0.0)>
```

When you're tired of watching the messages, detach:

```elixir
iex(node1@0.0.0.0)> RingLogger.detach
:ok
```

If you're the type of person who prefers to poll their logs, you can do that
too:

```elixir
iex(node1@0.0.0.0)> RingLogger.next

12:48:43.142 [debug] 285

12:48:44.143 [debug] 286

...

:ok
iex(node1@0.0.0.0)>
```

`RingLogger.next` keeps track of your position in the log so only new
messages get printed. If you create a new remote shell session, the position is
reset. You can also call `RingLogger.reset` to reset the position
manually. Keep in mind that logs are stored in a ring buffer, so as soon as the
log hits the maximum configured length, old messages will be discarded.
